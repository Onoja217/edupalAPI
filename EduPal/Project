# 📘 EduPal Offline Repository

**An Offline Learning Assistant Platform**

---

## 🎓 Overview  
- React + FastAPI • Docker • Kubernetes • CI/CD  
- Team: Engineering Team  
- Date: 21 Aug 2025 (Africa/Lagos)  

---

## ❌ Problem Statement  
- Internet-dependent educational content  
- Limited access in remote/restricted areas  
- Need for instant, reliable assistance  

---

## ✅ Our Solution / Value  
- Offline-capable assistant, self-contained, scalable, easy to maintain  
- **Value**: 100% offline • low resource needs • enterprise-ready • extensible  

---

## 📐 System Architecture  
- **Frontend**: UI/UX  
- **AI Engine**: Q&A processing  
- **Kubernetes**: orchestration & scaling  
- **CI/CD**: automated testing & deployments  

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack  
- **Frontend**: React 18 (hooks), Axios, CSS3 (Flex/Grid), CRA  
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python 3.9, Uvicorn, structured logging  
- **Infra**: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, NGINX  

---

## 🖥️ Frontend Implementation  
- Clean, responsive UI; real-time question submission  
- Loading states & error handling; optimized bundle  
- Perf: initial load < 2 MB; TTI < 3 s; fully responsive to 320 px  

---

## 🤖 AI Engine Implementation  
- FastAPI with OpenAPI docs; request/response validation  
- Extensible knowledge base; health checks (/ping, /qa)  
- Sample KB dict; docs at `/docs` and `/redoc`  

---

## 📦 Containerization  
- Multi-stage builds; Alpine base; layer caching; security-focused  
- Image sizes (approx): Frontend ~20 MB; AI Engine ~120 MB  

---

## ☸️ Kubernetes Deployment  
- Namespace isolation; rolling updates; resource limits; probes  
- HPA based on CPU; 2–5 replicas; 70% CPU threshold  

---

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline  
- **Flow**: Checkout & validate → Build & push → Deploy to K8s → Verify  
- Triggers on push to `main`; build caching; env substitution; rollback ready  

---

## 🧑‍💻 Local Development  
```bash
git clone … && cd frontend && npm install
docker-compose up
